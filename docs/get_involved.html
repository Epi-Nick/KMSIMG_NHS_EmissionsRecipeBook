<p>The NHS Emission Quantification Recipe Book has been designed to be a resilient and community-led endeavour that can be easily updated and kept relevant. The GitHub platform is an ideal way to facilitate this functionality. Please check the Get Involved section on the <a href="https://github.com/danwrisar/KMSIMG_NHS_EmissionsRecipeBook/#get-involved">GitHub repository</a> where Dr Dan Wright provides a quick overview of how you can get involved with the ongoing development of the NHS Emission Quantification Recipe Book through the GitHub forking, pull and commenting functions through a video.
