The NHS Emission Quantification Recipe Book is a transparent, collaborative and evidence-based approach to establishing a standardised means of calculating emissions associated with NHS Carbon Footprint and Carbon Footprint Plus themes set out by the Greener NHS in October 2020 (Figure 1). The NHS Emissions Quantification Recipe Book has been developed by Dr Dan Wright of the Sustainability Team at Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust in collaboration with members of the NHS Kent & Medway Integrated Care System.

Key to the methodologies specified is the recognition that NHS organisations are at different stages in their emissions quantification journey. To support this journey and provide an innovative means to report in a methodologically-transparent way, each theme provides three options for calculation:

  * A Reduced Calculation (RC) is intended to be an approach to calculating a ballpark figure emission impact using data that should be easily accessible by someone stepping into an emissions reporting role.
  * A Standard Calculation (SC) is intended to feature the minimum data that NHS organisations should be working towards sourcing and handling, for example, periodical energy consumption data.
  * An Optimal Calculation (OC) is intended to feature 'best in class' approaches to calculating accurate emissions, this may include using advanced tooling or higher resolution data, for example, half-hourly energy consumption data.

By being transparent around which methodological approach has been used, either RC, SC or OC, this supports 'comparing apples to apples' both within and between Integrated Care Systems.

<!-- There is a significant amount of subtle, yet precisely calibrated, styling to ensure
that your content is emphasized while still looking aesthetically pleasing.

All links are easy to [locate and discern](#), yet don't detract from the [harmony
of a paragraph](#). The _same_ goes for italics and __bold__ elements. Even the the strikeout
works if <del>for some reason you need to update your post</del>. For consistency's sake,
<ins>The same goes for insertions</ins>, of course.

### Code, with syntax highlighting

Here's an example of some ruby code with line anchors.

{% highlight ruby lineanchors %}
# The most awesome of classes
class Awesome < ActiveRecord::Base
  include EvenMoreAwesome

  validates_presence_of :something
  validates :email, email_format: true

  def initialize(email, name = nil)
    self.email = email
    self.name = name
    self.favorite_number = 12
    puts 'created awesomeness'
  end

  def email_format
    email =~ /\S+@\S+\.\S+/
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Here's some CSS:

{% highlight css %}
.foobar {
  /* Named colors rule */
  color: tomato;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's some JavaScript:

{% highlight js %}
var isPresent = require('is-present')

module.exports = function doStuff(things) {
  if (isPresent(things)) {
    doOtherStuff(things)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's some HTML:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="m0 p0 bg-blue white">
  <h3 class="h1">Hello, world!</h3>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

# Headings!

They're responsive, and well-proportioned (in `padding`, `line-height`, `margin`, and `font-size`).
They also heavily rely on the awesome utility, [BASSCSS](http://basscss.com).

##### They draw the perfect amount of attention

This allows your content to have the proper informational and contextual hierarchy. Yay.

### There are lists, too

  * Apples
  * Oranges
  * Potatoes
  * Milk

  1. Mow the lawn
  2. Feed the dog
  3. Dance

### Images look great, too

### There are also pretty colors

Also the result of [BASSCSS](http://basscss.com), you can <span class="bg-dark-gray white">highlight</span> certain components
of a <span class="red">post</span> <span class="mid-gray">with</span> <span class="green">CSS</span> <span class="orange">classes</span>.

I don't recommend using blue, though. It looks like a <span class="blue">link</span>.

### Footnotes!

Markdown footnotes are supported, and they look great! Simply put e.g. `[^1]` where you want the footnote to appear,[^1] and then add
the reference at the end of your markdown.

### Stylish blockquotes included

You can use the markdown quote syntax, `>` for simple quotes.

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse quis porta mauris.

However, you need to inject html if you'd like a citation footer. I will be working on a way to
hopefully sidestep this inconvenience.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
  </p>
  <footer><cite title="Antoine de Saint-Exupéry">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</cite></footer>
</blockquote>


### Tables

Tables represent tabular data and can be built using markdown syntax.  They are rendered responsively in Mixyll for a variety of screen widths.

Here's a simple example of a table:

| Quantity | Description |     Price |
|----------+-------------+----------:|
|        2 |      Orange |     $0.99 |
|        1 |   Pineapple |     $2.99 |
|        4 |      Banana |     $0.39 |
|==========|=============|===========|
|          |   **Total** | **$6.14** |

A table must have a body of one or more rows, but can optionally also have a header or footer.

The cells in a column, including the header row cell, can either be aligned:

- left,
- right or
- center.

Most inline text formatting is available in table cells, block-level formatting are not.

|----------------+----------------------+------------------------+----------------------------------|
| Default header | Left header          |     Center header      |                     Right header |
|----------------|:---------------------|:----------------------:|---------------------------------:|
| Default        | Left                 |        Center          |                            Right |
| *Italic*       | **Bold**             |   ***Bold italic***    |                      `monospace` |
| [link text](#) | ```code```           |     ~~Strikeout~~      |              <ins>Insertion<ins> |
| line<br/>break | "Smart quotes"       | <mark>highlight</mark> | <span class="green">green</span> |
| Footnote[^2]   | <sub>subscript</sub> | <sup>superscript</sup> |     <span class="red">red</span> |
|================+======================+========================+==================================+
| Footer row                                                                                        |
|----------------+----------------------+------------------------+----------------------------------|

Happy writing.

[^2]: Footnotes will work in tables since they're just links.
