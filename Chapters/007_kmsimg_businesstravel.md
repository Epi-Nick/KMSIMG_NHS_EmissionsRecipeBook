## Methodology

### Definition

Emissions associated with any vehicles formally claiming mileage expenses and/or any travel completedÂ where the reporting organisation has directly paid, or reimbursed the cost, including, but not limited to, travel by air, water, rail, bus and taxi.

> NOTE: Paul Chandler, Deputy Director of Net Zero Travel and Transports for Greener NHS, confirmed that reporting through business travel theme is to be restricted to vehicular transport and not include hotel stays etc. associted with business travel (27 October 2022).

### Calculations: Greyfleet

#### Data map

| Description of data available  | Reduced calculation [RC]  | Standard calculation [SC] | Optimal Calculation [OC] |
| ------------------------------ |:---:| :---:| :---:|
| |  |  |  |
| Total mileage (claim data) |  | X |  |
| Mileage per journey (claim data) |  |  | X |

#### Standard calculation: Greyfleet

*Equation 7.2* The SC approach for calculating emissions associated with greyfleet travel.

$$
\frac{\left( \text{TotMil} \times \text{kmConv} \right)\times \text{AvgFac}}
{1000} = \text{tCO}_2\text{e} \text{ [RC]}
$$

Where:
* TotMil = The total mileage completed by greyfleet over the period of interest.
* AvgFac = The total average emissions (gCO2) per kilometre for vehicles first registered in the United Kingdom five years prior to the period of interest.
* kmConv = 1.609344

#### Optimal calculation: Greyfleet

*Equation 7.3* The OC approach for calculating emissions associated with greyfleet.

$$
\frac{\left(\left(\text{V1Mil} \times \text{kmConv} \right) \times \text{V1Fac} \right) + \left(\left(\text{V2Mil} \times \text{kmConv} \right) \times \text{V2Fac} \right) ... }
{1000} = \text{tCO}_2\text{e} \text{ [SC]}
$$

Where: 

* V*n*Mil = The mileage completed by a unique vehicle over the period of interest (miles), the first unique vehicle being denoted 'V1' .
* V*n*Fac = The registered emissions (gCO2) per kilometre for the unique vehicle denoted 'V1'.
* kmConv = 1.609344
