## Methodology

### Definition

Emissions associated with the supply of natural gas, the transmission and distribution of electricity, and the supply of fuel for use by NHS Fleet, business-use only leased vehicles and business travel vehicles. 

> NOTE: The transmission and distribution of electricity is included here to mitigate potential 'scoping-out' of associated emissions while retaining accuracy of the methodologies outlined in [05 Electricity](/Chapters/001_kmsimg_fossilfuels.md).

### Calculations

**Reduced calculation: Natural gas**

*Equation 6.1* The RC approach for XXXXXX.

$$ 
\frac{\left( \text{ModCon} \times \text{A} \right) \times \text{Fac}}
{1000} = \text{tCO}_2\text{e} \text{ [RC]}
$$

Where:
* ModCon = Value of modelled annual energy use (kWh/m<sup>2</sup>) from the relevant Display Energy Certificate.
* A = Value of total useful floor area (m<sup>2</sup>) from the relevant Display Energy Certificate.
* Fac = Carbon factor assigned to the fuel by the relevant BEIS carbon factor database publication.

**Standard calculation: Natural gas**

*Equation 6.2* The SC approach for XXXXXX.

$$ 
\frac{\left( \text{ModCon} \times \text{A} \right) \times \text{Fac}}
{1000} = \text{tCO}_2\text{e} \text{ [RC]}
$$

Where:
* XXX = XXX

**Standard calculation: Electricity**

*Equation 6.5* The SC approach for XXXXXX.

$$ 
\frac{\left( \text{ModCon} \times \text{A} \right) \times \text{Fac}}
{1000} = \text{tCO}_2\text{e} \text{ [RC]}
$$

Where:
* XXX = XXX

**Standard calculation: NHS Fleet and leased vehicles**

*Equation 6.8* The SC approach for XXXXXX.

$$ 
\frac{\left( \text{ModCon} \times \text{A} \right) \times \text{Fac}}
{1000} = \text{tCO}_2\text{e} \text{ [RC]}
$$

Where:
* XXX = XXX

## Examples

**Standard calculation: Natural gas**

Stu sources the Display Energy Certification (DEC) for the building he is interested in. Using information from the Building Energy Use figure (Figure 1.1), Stu multiplies the annual energy use of other fuels (328) by the total useful floor area for the building (2778.54). The calculated annual total consumption (911,361.12) is presented in kWh. 

By using the BEIS Carbon Factors  for the year he is interested in (2019), Stu was able to source a value for emissions per kWh of natural gas use assuming gross calorific value (0.18385kgCO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh). Stu wanted to report in tonnes, therefore divided the sum by 1,000. This value was then rounded to 2 decimal places. 
Along with adding their units (tCO<sub>2</sub>e), Stu added the [RC] tag to support transparency around how this figure was calculated using a reduced data calculation method. The final value added to Stuâ€™s report on emissions associated with natural gas consumption was 167.55tCO<sub>2</sub>e [RC].

*Equation X.4* A worked example of emissions associated with XXXXXXXX using an RC method.

$$ 
\frac{\left( 328 \times 2778.54 \right) \times 0.18385}
{1000} = 167.55\text{tCO}_2\text{e} \text{ [RC]}
$$

**Standard Calculation**

*Equation X.5* A worked example of emissions associated with XXXXXXXX using an SC method.

**Optimal Calculation**

*Equation X.6* A worked example of emissions associated with XXXXXXXX using an OC method.
